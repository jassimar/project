# Mini Project (cut)

Name: Jassim Abdul Rahman
MIS: 111403019

This is a program which is an exact replica of the pre-installed Linux/Unix command "cut". Basically it cuts from files and displays on the screen bytes, characters, fields or lines. The option of cutting lines is not availiable in the actual cut function.

For more info on how to use the function, either run "./project --help" OR "man cut".
